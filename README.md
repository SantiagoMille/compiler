Compiling and running Instructions

1. In order to compile the project it is only necessary to run the already made executable called "make" as such: ./make
This will execute the necessary commands to compile both the scanner (flex) and the parser(bison). 

NOTE: It is necessary that the 'make.c' file and the executable 'make' are in the same folder as the flex and bison files (.l and .y files) 

2. In order to run and test the program one must open a terminal in the same folder where the flex, the bison, and the make file are. Then in the terminal one should execute the compiler as: 
./compiler < file.txt

2.1. file.txt is the input file (change file.txt to the name and extension of the desired input file)
